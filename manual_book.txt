respect during expeditions.

participants. Your behavior reflects the entire group.

# Expedition Protocols

## If the Host Dies/Is Impeded During the Climb

- If there is no Co-Host, choose one participant to lead.
- Less than 5 minutes from the summit: If you cannot catch up, ask the Co-Host or atrusted participant to take the summit photo for you.

## If the Host Must Leave in the Middle of an Expedition
- You are responsible for appointing a leader before leaving.
- Transfer leadership to the Co-Host
- If none are available, appoint a trusted participant to lead and ask them to provide a screenshot at the summit.
- A Co-Host who takes over officially becomes the new Host for the remainder of the expedition.

## If the Co-Host Leaves
- If the Co-Host leaves after completing at least half of the route, they will still be counted as a Co-Host.
- If they leave before the halfway point, they are not counted as a Co-Host.

## Canceling an Expedition

- If no climbers show up

## Role of Co-Host 
- Maximum of 2 Co-Hosts per expedition.
- Co-Hosts must assist the Host, ensure everyone is following, wait for AFK climbers, and guide participants who are lagging.

# Managing Climbers

## Warning Climbers
Guides are authorized to enforce rules and issue warnings. Warnings should be given for the following situations:
- Too far ahead of the guide: Being out of sight or more than 5 minutes ahead.
-Disruptive or Disrespectful Behavior: Persistently pushing climbers on ladders, blocking paths, etc.
-Light jokes are fine, but not to the point of being disrespectful.
- Violating Roblox ToS: Including hacking, glitching, swearing, discrimination, or verbally attacking others.
- Ignoring Instructions: Repeatedly ignoring instructions from the Host or Co-Host.

## Procedure
1. As a general rule, politely ask the climber to stop first before issuing a formal warning.

3. Typically, a participant who receives three warnings will be removed from the expedition.
4. All warnings given must be reported to the Guide Director.
